# 14-Puzzle-Solver
This program solves 14 puzzle problems in the shortest amount of moves. It uses A* Graph Search strategy to accomplish this. 
To use this program, create an input text file in the same directory named "board.txt" with the board configuration in the 
following format: 

a a a a
b b b b
c c c c
d d d d

The output will be created in a separate text file in the same directory. 14-puzzle problem: On a 4 x 4 board there are 14 
tiles numbered from 1 to 14 and two blank positions. A tile can slide into any of the two blank positions if it is horizontally
or vertically adjacent to the blank position. Given a start board configuration and a goal board configuration, find a sequence
of moves to reach the goal configuration from the start configuration.
